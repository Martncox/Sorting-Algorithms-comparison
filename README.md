Java was king by execution time with c++ in second and python last. Python is slower due to being an interpreted language with dynamic typing, which adds overhead. It uses dynamically sized lists instead of fixed arrays, causing extra memory costs. Python also lacks recursion optimization and has slower random number generation and less precise time measurement compared to C++ and Java, contributing to its overall slower performance.
